# Mayan Stele Fragment Reconstruction System

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to digitally reconstruct a fragmented **Mayan stele** using advanced 3D computer vision and deep learning techniques. The central topic is automatic artifact reassembly, where broken stone fragments are scanned as 3D point clouds and then analyzed to detect break surfaces, extract geometric features, and identify possible matches. To tackle this challenge, I preprocess the fragments with multi-scale downsampling and clustering, represent them as graphs of potential connections, and train a graph neural network and Siamese-based models to predict which fragments belong together. These predictions are refined with alignment algorithms like Iterative Closest Point (ICP), while ground truth reconstructions provide assembly knowledge to guide the model. Ultimately, the system aims to move from scattered fragments to a coherent, near-complete digital reconstruction of the stele, reducing manual effort while preserving archaeological heritage.

## Key Challenges & Learnings

### üöß Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **Limited Dataset and Deep Learning Overfitting**
    - Extremely small dataset (only a few Mayan stele fragments available) caused severe overfitting in initial deep learning approaches
    - Neural networks memorized training examples instead of learning generalizable patterns
    - **Solution**: Shifted to robust geometric methods that work with minimal data
    - **Future Direction**: Acquire larger datasets or develop data augmentation techniques for deep learning viability
2. **Color-based Break Surface Detection**
    - Initial clustering approaches were unreliable with real mesh data
    - **Solution**: Developed direct mesh vertex color thresholding with configurable ranges
    - **Learning**: Simple approaches often work better than complex ones for noisy archaeological data

![Screenshot from 2025-09-28 15-36-52.png](mayan_stele_readme%2027cedc65e15f80c1bb0be43dbed3117b/Screenshot_from_2025-09-28_15-36-52.png)

1. **Surface Matching Complexity**
    - Naive geometric similarity led to many false matches
    - **Solution**: Multi-criteria scoring with domain-specific weights
    - **Learning**: Archaeological fragments require specialized similarity measures beyond standard geometric descriptors
2. **Fragment Assembly Strategy**
    - Random pairwise alignment created accumulating errors
    - **Solution**: Origin-based progressive assembly starting from best-connected fragment
    - **Learning**: Assembly order significantly impacts final reconstruction quality
3. **Real vs. Synthetic Data Gap**
    - Algorithms working on perfect synthetic data failed on real archaeological meshes
    - **Solution**: Robust preprocessing pipeline with mesh validation and repair
    - **Learning**: Archaeological data has unique characteristics (weathering, scanning artifacts) requiring specialized handling

### üí° Archaeological Domain Insights

1. **Break Surface Characteristics**: Real fractures don‚Äôt always have perfectly matching geometry due to weathering and material loss
2. **Scale Considerations**: Fragment sizes vary dramatically, requiring scale-invariant features
3. **Assembly Ambiguity**: Multiple valid local arrangements may exist, requiring global optimization

### üõ†Ô∏è Software Engineering Learnings

## Project Summary

**The Challenge**: Ancient stone fragments are extremely difficult to reconstruct because weathered break surfaces look nearly identical and provide few clues about which pieces originally fit together.

**Our Solution**:

- Mark break surfaces with colored paint (red, blue, green) during 3D scanning
- Build software that detects these colored regions automatically
- Extract geometric features like surface shape, curvature, and size from each colored area
- Use intelligent matching algorithms to find which colored surfaces from different fragments could have once been connected
- Assemble fragments step-by-step, starting with the most confident matches and bringing break surfaces into physical contact

**What We Built**: A complete automated reconstruction system that takes scattered 3D fragment scans as input and outputs a digitally reconstructed artifact with millimeter-level precision.

**Key Innovation**: Instead of trying to match entire complex stone surfaces, we focus computational power only on the break regions - turning an impossible search problem into a solvable computer vision task.

**Impact**: Successfully reconstructs multi-fragment Mayan stele assemblies while providing quality metrics to validate the accuracy of each reconstruction.
